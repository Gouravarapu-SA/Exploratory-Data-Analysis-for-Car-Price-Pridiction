> A data-rich exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on a car dataset. This notebook walks through key steps in cleaning, processing, and visualizing automobile data, as well as performing correlation analysis and feature engineering for potential predictive modeling.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory analysis on an automobile dataset. It aims to:
- Clean and prepare the dataset
- Visualize various relationships using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Engineer new features such as `city-L/100km` and `horsepower-binned`
- Perform basic correlation and statistical tests to understand feature relevance

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🐍 Python 3.8+
- 📦 pandas, numpy, scipy
- 📉 seaborn, matplotlib
